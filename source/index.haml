    %h2 We invite you to join us for the Savory Institutes's Annual International Conference, this year to be held in London on August 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>
    %p This central location will allow our partners and collaborators from around the globe to join us and contribute to this special event. We will spotlight grasslands for all their under-appreciated beauty and value. We will also foster conversations around the unifying language of the land which bridges all cultures. Our movement is about real people with dirt under their fingernails and families to feed, people unified by a love of the land, a desire to understand nature's rhythms and cycles and the magical beauty of abundant life in the soil. These are people that want security for their children, prosperous landscapes, and a life filled by a deep personal connection with nature.

    %blockquote The age of Holistic Management is upon us. There is an undeniable need for humans to honor the complexity of the natural world. We've seen a new awakening among people to embrace living in harmony with their environment.The movement has reached critical mass and is exploding all around the globe.
