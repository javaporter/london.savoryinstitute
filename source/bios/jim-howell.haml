%h1 Jim Howell
%p Jim Howell was raised both in California and Colorado, where his family has ranched since the late 1800s. He graduated summa cum laude with a B.S. in Animal Science from Cal Poly Pomona, completing his final year as a foreign exchange student at Lincoln University in New Zealand in 1991. Right out of college, Jim cowboyed on a large diversified ranching operation in western Colorado, then managed a 1000-cow pasture-based dairy in east Texas. From 1994-96, he co-managed (with wife Daniela) the 34,000 acre High Lonesome Ranch in the Chihuahua Desert of southwestern New Mexico. After traveling extensively in Africa in 1996, Jim and Daniela settled on Jim’s family’s ranch in high altitude southwestern Colorado, near Cimarron, where they've managed multiple grazing, hunting, forestry, and educational enterprises on both the family ranch and adjacent leased ranches. Jim and Daniela have also led close to thirty educational trips to ecologically and economically vibrant, creatively managed ranches in Argentina, Australia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, and New Zealand. In his former consulting practice, Jim helped bring holistic management decision making and planning to ranching clients across the American West. He now leads the Savory Institute’s land management arm, Grasslands, LLC, where he is a partner and co-founder. Jim is also a co-founder of the Savory Institute. He has published one book, For the Love of Land—Global Case Studies of Grazing in Nature’s Image. Jim and Daniela have two young daughters—Savanna and Mia, and are now based in Boulder, Colorado
