%h1 Richard Teague
%p Dr. Richard Teague is the Professor of Ecosystem Science and Management at Texas A&M University AgriLife Research. He believes that research and service must provide the linkage that enables managers to base decisions for sustainable land use on the principles of ecosystem function. He has used four key elements to enhance this linkage: a systems research program, resource accounting, long-term assessment and partnering with rancher clientele. He uses a systems approach in developing land and livestock management practices that sustain natural rangeland resources and the people depending on the land. His goals are to broaden the understanding of requirements needed to sustain rangeland resources and economic viability, and generate science based information to allow producers to improve management practices on rangeland.
