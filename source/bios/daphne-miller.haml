%h1 Daphne Miller
%p Daphne Miller, MD is a family physician, writer, and Associate Professor in the Department of Family Medicine at the University of California San Francisco. In 2000 she founded <a href="http://www.wholefamilymd.org/wfmd/", target="_blank">WholefamilyMD</a>, San Franciscoâ€™s first integrative primary care practice, where she still cares for patients across the lifespan.
%p Part clinician, part ecologist, and part anthropologist, Miller approaches medicine with the idea that opportunities for health and healing are found not only in the medical system but in such unexpected places as home kitchens, school gardens, community organizations, spiritual centers, farms, and nature trails. Throughout her career, her teaching, writing, and advocacy work has reflected this perspective.
%p In her latest book, <a href="http://drdaphne.com/wordpress/books/", target="_blank"><em>Farmacology: What Innovative Family Farming Can Teach Us About Health and Healing</em></a>, Miller discovers how learning from sustainable farmers can make her a better doctor. Her first book, the Jungle Effect, a Northern California Bestseller, chronicles her voyages to areas around the world that are still relatively free of modern chronic diseases. Miller is a regular contributor to the Health section of the Washington Post and  has been interviewed and profiled in a wide range of publications and media outlets, including the New York Times, O Magazine, Harvard Medical Magazine, Vogue, the Michael Krasny Show and the Dr Oz Show.
