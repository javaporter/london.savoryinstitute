%h1 Brittany Cole Bush
%p Brittany “Cole” Bush is a self-deemed modern-day, urban shepherdess in the Bay Area of Northern California and first generation female rancher. Shepherding animals, people and projects, she is a project manager of a contract grazing outfit called Star Creek Land Stewards, working with upwards of 1,200 head of sheep and goats to perform specialized grazing projects for fire hazard reduction and land stewardship. Her team consists of individuals whose family heritage working with sheep, goes back to the Basque country of Spain and France for multiple generations; also a family of Peruvian herders who live and work in the United States on special H2A work Visas assisting with the daily herding and management of the livestock, a team of trained Border Collie sheep dogs and Great Pyrenees x Anatolian guard dogs, and lest we forget, about 1,200 Dorper hair-sheep and Spanish x Boer goats. Together they comprise an innovative and thriving new kind of enterprise within the sheep and goat industry—land stewardship and vegetation management with carefully planned and managed grazing projects serving the urban peripheries of the Bay Area as contract grazers.
%p Brittany is honored to be a part of the next generation of farmers and ranchers who value the regenerative potentials of land stewardship while raising healthy animals for food. She is an active participant in the young farmer and rancher community of the western coastal states of the U.S. through the Agrarian Trust, FiberShed, and the development of the future Savory Hub of Northern California. She also is working to develop technological tools to better the communication, education and logistical organization for contract grazing projects.
%p Through upholding the integrity and respect for the ancient cultural wisdom working with livestock on the land, while being supported by innovative approaches of the 21st century, Brittany works to represent the next generation of land stewards, ranchers and farmers to create a more stable and thriving food system while addressing environmental regenerative practices through Holistic Management.
%h2 Holistic Management Relationship
%p Since the beginning of her journey with ranching, she was fortunate to be mentored by a number of experienced ranchers who were already practitioners of Holistic Management and were eager to share the work they were doing on their respective ranches. Having begun her ranching career alongside the opportunity to see Holistic Management put to use, as well as becoming a part of a thriving ranching community working towards similar goals on the land with animals, she has become dedicated to continue to learn, practice and share this good work. Brittany intends to pursue professional accreditation through the Savory Institute.
