%h1 Mimi Hillenbrand
%p Margaret Hillenbrand is the owner and operator of the 777 Ranch which has been in her family since the early 1970’s. It is located on the short grass prairie between the Black Hills and the Badlands of southwestern South Dakota. In the 1980’s the ranch made a management decision to change from cattle to bison, and how to care for the land better. We wanted to heal the land and bring back the biodiversity of the land. About the same time we began running bison, Holistic Management made its appearance. The whole ranch staff took the beginning course and has never looked back. It has been almost 30 years since beginning Holistic Management and the ranch has flourished. The changes have taken time but by planning our grazing and monitoring the land the ranch has become healthy, sustainable, and resilient.
%p The 777 Ranch runs around 1,500 bison on just under 30,000 acres (about 15,000 hectares). They are sold as breeding stock and for the grass fed market. The 777 Ranch have been in several films, documentaries, commercials, and several publications. We are very proud of what we accomplished so far, and we are looking forward to the future.
%p Margaret Hillenbrand received and B.S. in Wildlife Biology from the University of Montana, Missoula, Montana and is currently pursuing a graduate degree in Agriculture ( Integrated   Resource Management) from the University of Colorado, Fort Collins, Colorado.
