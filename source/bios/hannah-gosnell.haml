%h1 Hannah Gosnell
%p Hannah Gosnell is an Associate Professor of Geography in the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State University. Her research interests have to do with agricultural landscape change, water resource management, climate change and environmental governance in the context of rural working landscapes; and how laws and institutions might evolve to better reflect changing geographies and facilitate social-ecological transformation when necessary. As a social scientist, most of her research focuses on the human dimensions of rangeland management. She has been funded by the US Department of Agriculture to investigate the role rangeland managers can play in various “payments for ecosystem services” schemes, including voluntary and compliance carbon markets in the US, Australia, and New Zealand. Recent research in Australia focused on sheep and cattle farmers’ experiences transitioning from conventional range management to Holistic Management. She is particularly interested in the social, cultural, and psychological aspects of the HM transition process and the implications for landowners’ capacity to adapt to social, economic and environmental change. Dr. Gosnell earned her PhD in Geography from the University of Colorado in 2000, and is an Associate Editor for Rangeland Ecology and Management.
