%p Jacqui Dunne is an award-winning journalist from Ireland, founder and CEO of Danu Resource, and an emerging leader in helping entrepreneurs develop technologies and initiatives that restore the earth’s equilibrium globally.
%p Jacqui is the co-author of, Rethinking Money, which points out that there is a way, in fact a thousand ways, to stop our current juggernaut towards global self-destruction. There is a system of solutions already in place in localities throughout the world where terrible problems have existed.  The changes came about, not through the redistribution of wealth, increased conventional taxation, bond measures or enlightened self-interest from corporate entities, but rather, by people simply rethinking the concept of money.  With that restructuring, everything changed.
%p Remedies for Government, Business and Entrepreneurship, NGOs and the Civil Society, and the private citizen are offered. The book also presents clear validation, speaking plainly and directly to general interest readers. This work promises to strike a deep chord with audiences eager to find meaningful, thought-provoking answers.
%p Jacqui lives in Colorado and currently writes for the Huffington Post’s Business section.
