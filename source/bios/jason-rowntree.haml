He is the faculty coordinator for two Michigan State University Research Centers: Lake City and the Upper Peninsula Research and Extension Center.
%p Specifically Dr. Rowntree has three primary areas of research and outreach interest: 1) improving energy efficiency at the farm level through properly managed grazing and integrated cropping systems; 2) understanding the impact of grazing systems on GHG flux and 3) development of pasture-based local beef production systems. He is currently developing a genetic beef cattle base using Red Angus across the two research facilities to provide grass finishing genetics to the upper Midwest. In the first two years they have marketed over 150 head of beef cattle into grass finishing markets.
