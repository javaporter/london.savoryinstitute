  I work with many growers on issues of importance to Holistic Management, particularly how life in the soil influences and interacts with animal grazing. Most people don't consider that one of the reasons why Holistic Management works is because of the organisms in the soil. To properly build soil, with all the benefits that a healthy soil can bring, one must understand the soil food web.
