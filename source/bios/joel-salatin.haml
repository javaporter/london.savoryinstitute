  'Who inspires you?' is a common question people ask me. A handful of names comes to mind, and one of them is Allan Savory. When he first came to the U.S. I read his material and immediately felt affirmed in what our family had been doing, but also challenged to do better. Every time I meet Allan, whether through the written word, one of his proteges, as an audience member at a presentation, or informally conversing with him, I'm convicted to think better, speak better, and farm better. Few people have had such a profound positive influence on my life and I count it a distinct honor to have lived when Allan's shadow could be cast on me.
