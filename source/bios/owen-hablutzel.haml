          %h2 Owen Hablutzel
          %p Owen Hablutzel is an independent consultant, group-facilitator, and educator performing international work with a range of clientele to enact whole-system transformations toward robust land health, social co-creative capacity, and whole ecosystem stewardship.
          %p Living, working and learning across a multiplicity of cultural-ecological contexts (North and southern Africa, Australia, Middle-East, Europe and North America) Owen brings a diverse constellation of experiences and training to his work in broad-acre and regional systems. This work integrates bio-physical applications (Keyline&reg;, Permaculture, and Holistic Management&reg;) with social technologies (co-creative participatory process facilitation) and with a wider spectrum of practical, flexible, engaged solutions (social-ecological systems science) for human re-connection with our earth system source.
          %p Whether with ranches, classrooms, NGOs, farms, non-profits, agencies/ministries or other land managing/policy groups, the core work remains collaborative empowerment with people, organizations, institutions, and communities enacting positive transformations to sustainability and beyond.
          %p Owen is a director of the Permaculture Research Institute, USA, a Certified Educator of Holistic Management, serves on the Resilience Task Force of the IUCN-CEM (International Union for Conservation of Nature - Committee for Ecosystem Management) and holds a Masters in Eastern Philosophy from St. John's College in New Mexico.
