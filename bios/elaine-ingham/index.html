                  <h2>Dr. Elaine Ingham</h2>
                  <p>Dr. Elaine Ingham is President of Soil Foodweb Inc., an international laboratory system that assesses the balance of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, nematodes and mycorrhizal fungi in all materials. The major emphasis of her work is to return health to soil, so that natural nutrient cycling and disease suppression mechanisms are present, allowing the desired plants to grow without requiring use of pesticides or inorganic fertilizers. Dr. Ingham has been conducting workshops and seminars around the world for the past 30 years. She was recently Chief Scientist at Rodale Institute <a href='http://rodaleinstitute.org/'>http://rodaleinstitute.org/.</a> Dr. Ingham earned her PhD from the Colorado State University in 1981. Her doctorate is in Microbiology with an emphasis on soil. Along with her husband Russ (who also has a doctorate from Colorado State University in Zoology, emphasizing nematology), she was offered a post-doctoral fellowship at the Natural Resource Ecology Lab at Colorado State University. In 1985, she accepted a Research Associate Fellowship at the University of Georgia. In 1986, Ingham moved to Oregon State University and joined the faculty in both Forest Science and Botany and Plant Pathology. She remained on faculty until 2001. Dr. Ingham is also an Affiliate Professor, Graduate Research, at Southern Cross University in Lismore, NSW, Australia, and an Affiliate Professor of Sustainable Living at Maharishi University of Management in Fairfield, Iowa, and was Program Chair of the Ecological Society of America from 1999 to 2000.</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    I work with many growers on issues of importance to Holistic Management, particularly how life in the soil influences and interacts with animal grazing. Most people don't consider that one of the reasons why Holistic Management works is because of the organisms in the soil. To properly build soil, with all the benefits that a healthy soil can bring, one must understand the soil food web.
