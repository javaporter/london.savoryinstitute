              <h1>Martien Lankester</h1>
              <p>Martien Lankester (1949) was trained as a Medical Doctor (graduated 1975, University of Amsterdam) and as a Public Health specialist (graduated 1987).</p>
              <p>As a medical student he traveled through Africa and was struck by the compelling issue of food security. He decided to get acquainted with sustainable food issues and established an organic restaurant in Amsterdam (1973).</p>
              <p>After graduating as a medical doctor he established a practice in Fryslân giving nutritional and lifestyle advice (1975). Subsequently he set up the biodynamic dairy farm Hof van Edens (Garden of Edens) and an organic food shop (1977) connected to his medical practice in the tiny village of Edens. With this he wanted to show the relation between sustainable development, food production, ecology, nature and nutrition. He also gave numerous lectures on these subjects in the Northern part of the country.</p>
              <p>This led to a small group of dairy farmers converting to organic farming and a contract (possibly the first ever) between a large nature conservation organization and these farmers on sustainable management of their traditional pastures (1981).</p>
              <p>In the late 1980’s he was elected chair of the national Biodynamic Association and statutory chair of the national Platform for Organic Farming.</p>
              <p>In 1990 he initiated and subsequently established the Avalon Foundation based on the needs expressed in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). This international nonprofit organization has since been promoting organic agriculture and food, agro biodiversity and sustainable rural development in more than 30 countries with developing economies. Its work is based on local needs and ideas, involving and training local organizations and experts. Avalon has since its establishment developed and implemented around 100 projects in more than 30 countries with a small core staff, some associate experts and numerous local partners. In 2008 the first branch office was established in Bulgaria. Many of the projects have a multi country character. Projects include training of farmers and farm advisors, market chain development, demonstration farms, agri-environment policy development and capacity building of organizations. In recent years also the beneficial effect of organic farming on biodiversity (leading to business and biodiversity projects) and climate issues has become part of the Avalon agenda. Avalon has also organized a number of international conferences on these issues. Avalon’s Network of 200 organizations in 32 countries (all working on the cutting edge of agriculture, environment and nature conservation) has received broad recognition (among others funding from the EU DG Environment) as an important instrument for change. Since a few years Avalon has broadened its scope to regions further South and East: projects in Central Asia, the Caucasus, Turkey and Africa have been successfully implemented.</p>
              <p>Increasingly Avalon seeks for strategic alliances in order to create synergy. Avalon has worked in a number of former conflict areas (Balkan, Caucasus) and finds that jointly working on economically sound sustainable farming adds a feeling of joint idealism, thus contributing to new friendship and solidarity.</p>
              <h4>Avalon has been a pioneer in among others</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Working structurally on organic farming development in the new market economies in Eastern Europe (from 1991)</li>
                <li>Organizing the first ever seminar for high level policy makers (four ministers, 8 vice-ministers) on organic farming in 1993</li>
                <li>Establishing the first demonstration farms for organic farming in the Danube Delta (1996)</li>
                <li>Introducing the concept of agri-environmental programs (paying farmers for green services) in fourteen countries (from 1996)</li>
                <li>Organizing the first European conference on organic farming (on request of the Austrian government and the European Commission) in 1999</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Martien Lankester is the driven executive director of Avalon, and has been project leader of many of the multi country projects and conferences. He has thus served as a goodwill ambassador for organic farming and sustainable rural development in the new market economies of CEE and beyond. He is a specialist in:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>networking on different levels (NGO’s, governments, scientists, businesses)</li>
                <li>integrating organic agriculture with nature conservation, biodiversity, environment and climate</li>
                <li>overseeing the complete value chain from farm to fork</li>
                <li>coordinating complicated innovative processes</li>
                <li>turning ambition into practice</li>
                <li>enthusing</li>
                <li>fundraising</li>
              </ul>
              <p>He currently works on establishing an international coalition that will support the much needed paradigm shift in food and agriculture.</p>
              <p>Besides his work for Avalon Martien has been for six years chairman of the Supervisory Board of IUCN Netherlands Committee (the umbrella of nature conservation organizations) and is member of the Advisory Council of the care farm Gerbranda State.</p>
              <p>He still likes working on his farm (although most of his land is used by a relative for his organic dairy farm), where organic fruit juice is being produced from his orchard in the Garden of Edens.</p>
              He was runner up for the Sicco Mansholt prize in 2004 after winner Franz Fischler.
