              <h1>Patrick Holden</h1>
              <p>Patrick grew up in London but was deeply influenced by a year he spent in California at the beginning of the seventies. He returned to the UK to study biodynamic agriculture and started a community dairy farm in West Wales in 1973. His farm, Bwlchwernen Fawr, is now the longest established organic dairy farm in Wales, with a herd of 75 Ayrshire cows—the milk from which is made into an award winning cheddar-style cheese by his son, Sam.</p>
              <p>Between 1995 and 2010, he was the director of the Soil Association and became a much sought after speaker and campaigner for organic food and farming. He spearheaded a number of prominent food campaigns around BSE, pesticide residues and GM food. More recently, he was a member of the UK Government’s working group on the Foresight Report into Future of Food and Farming and received a CBE for services to organic farming in 2005.</p>
              <p>Patrick is the founding director of the <a href="http://sustainablefoodtrust.org/">Sustainable Food Trust</a> whose mission is to promote international cooperation between all those involved in sustainable food production – not just those who are certified organic. The Sustainable Food Trust is focusing on two issues currently: True cost accounting and the individual systems to bring about change in the food system as a whole.</p>
              <p>In the current food system, food producers, particularly intensive producers, are not held accountable for downstream external costs, including, but not limited to: Depletion of natural capital, emissions, pollution, biodiversity damage, public health costs, and social and cultural costs arising from the present food system.</p>
              <p>His other current positions include: Patron of the Bio-dynamic Agricultural Association, the Living Earth and the Soil Association Land Trust; Senior Environmental Advisor to JCB and International Ambassador of the Soil Association.</p>

              <h3>Connection to Holistic Management</h3>
              <p>"My inspiration comes from a lifelong relationship with nature and the land, stemming from an urban childhood marked by frequent farming holidays. This relationship has brought me a deep sense of stewardship and custodianship. We are custodians of the planet; we must do everything possible to look after the land and bring it fertility.</p>
              <p>"Having been aware of the principles and benefits of the holistic grazing management system for some years, I am in the process of making some significant changes in the infrastructure relating to my grazing systems to enable its practical application with my 80 cow Ayrshire dairy herd. This has included laying one and a half miles of cattle tracks, the erection of electric fencing to subdivide the fields into paddocks and the installation of water troughs to support rotational grazing. I am convinced that the benefits of this system will result in significantly increased productivity from my grazing pastures."</p>
